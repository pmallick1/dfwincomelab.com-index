										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1>When school starts in the fall, student&#8217;s social &amp; emotional well-being should be a priority</h1>
<p>The <a href="https://mikvachallenge.org/blog/national-youth-response-movement/">National Youth Response Movement</a>, made up of 22 students from 14 cities across the country, has identified mental health and social-emotional well being has been negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. As schools transitioned to distance learning or closed altogether, many of the sources of comfort, opportunities for social &amp; emotional development, and access to trusted adults or important services were taken away. With this in mind, our students are advocating for social-emotional and youth mental health to be a priority for schools this fall.</p>
<p>Please join us in asking school leaders and local officials to support and implement these four policies by sending them the letter below. Use our letter template below and make it your own, so that it&#8217;s relevant to your school and local community.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s help our schools be ready to support students this fall!</p>
<h3>Letter template:</h3>
<div>
<p>Dear (School Leader, Local Decision Maker),</p>
<p>I hope you and your family are healthy and well during these unprecedented times. We are Mikva Challenge’s National Youth Response Movement, a team of students working on responding to the COVID-19 pandemic. As you are aware, over the past few months most people are staying at home as much as they can to practice social distancing and keep our communities safe. Despite these unprecedented times, this past week has served as yet another reminder of the continuous injustice many communities and students face. These events have a huge impact on students’ mental health all while having limited access to the mental supports all students deserve.</p>
<p>When school once again resumes, we believe that every student will need access to mental health services and support to their social-emotional well-being, especially because mental health problems may have developed or social-emotional well-being worsened, during this pandemic. To ensure that every student gets the equal treatment they need, here are our policy recommendations:</p>
<p>Fund professional development for teachers and school staff on trauma-informed school activities and social-emotional learning strategies.<br />
Fund more school-based health professionals and centers that integrate mental and physical health services to support the school community<br />
Evaluate schools’ performance on supporting students’ well-being by using performance indicators such as school climate, building positive student/teacher/school staff relationships, and connecting students to services provided by the school.<br />
Acknowledge that many students belonging to minority groups have faced issues specifically connected to their racial/ethnic/cultural background and will need different supports to respond to their unique situation. Allow additional funding to go to schools, especially schools with higher proportions of minority students, with the purpose of finding ways to hire culturally responsive mental health providers to make students more comfortable and provide the support they need.</p>
<p>We believe these policy recommendations are extremely important for schools to implement, as students will need the support of their school communities and leaders to address the negative impact due to the pandemic and continuous racial injustice.</p>
<p>If possible, could we set up a meeting to discuss these policy recommendations and how we can work together to advocate for them to be implemented at a state-wide/district/school level?</p>
<p>Thank you for your valuable time! Please feel free to reach out to me at <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>(Insert Email Here)</em></span> or <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>(Insert Phone Number Here)</em></span> with any questions you may have! We hope to speak to you soon!</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>(Closing &#8211; i.e. Sincerely, Best Regards, Looking forward to hearing from you, etc)</em></span>,</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>(Your Name)</em></span><br />

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Tony McDade, Ahmaud Arbery,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and countless other black people have been killed at the hands of the police and white citizens – in the past few months and throughout the history of this country. This violence is rooted in America’s reluctance to acknowledge and remove the white supremacy and racism from the laws and structures of its institutions and the minds and hearts of its white citizens.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mikva Challenge supports the protesters and Black Lives Matter in the struggle to create a new America free of its history of racial oppression. At Mikva, one of our most powerful activities has students creating a <a href="https://mikvachallenge.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Root-Cause-Tree-for-Teachers.pdf">Root Cause Tree</a> on a social problem, and we believe this is a moment for all of America to conduct a root cause analysis in order to dig out the roots of systemic racism.  This will not be easy and pain-free work. We have to accept this challenge and rise to meet it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite the open wounds and the pain, the exhaustion, the anger, and the trauma of our black brothers and sisters, at Mikva Challenge, we do see hope for change in this country. The hope comes from the leadership – both young and old – that we see on the streets and in our social media feeds, showing up to protest and demand a new social contract built on dignity, equity, and justice. We see Mikva Challenge alumni leading protests, food drives, reporting the news from the front lines, and educating their peers about structural racism. We also see in our programs young people speaking out on racial justice in their communities, schools, and country. In the coming months, you will hear and see a lot of these voices on Mikva Challenge’s social media feeds, in our e-newsletters, and on our new Mikva racial justice blog. We are committed to shining a bright light on Mikva youth leaders, and we encourage you to listen to their wisdom and inspiration in the coming weeks and months.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We also commit the organization to continue examining our own internal structures for racism and inequity, and having the hard conversations about how to fully live up to our stated mission and values. Mikva will not settle for the status quo, and we will challenge ourselves to live into our mission everyday of centering our work around youth leaders and youth voices from marginalized communities.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We know that positive change requires reflection, honesty, and strategic action. To that end, we share a few reflections by our staff leadership below and a handful of Soapbox statements on racial justice via Mikva’s Project Soapbox initiative. <a href="https://mikvachallenge.org/blog/our-commitment-to-racial-justice-and-root-cause-work#player">This is the start</a> of a sharing process that we will continue with students, alumni, and board members in the weeks and months to come.</span></p>
<div class="direct-anchor-wrap"><span id="Green" class="direct-anchor" style="visibility: hidden;">.</span></div>
<p><strong>Verneé Green, Executive Director, Mikva Challenge IL</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’m having a hard time with this, because I don’t have just one story. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a black woman in America, m</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">y life and the lives of my family members and those who look like me have decades of stories when it comes to social justice, racial equity and the lack thereof. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’ve processed the events of the past few days on a personal and professional level, I have numerous stories that I could tell about how I or my children have been marginalized, dismissed or harassed by systems, including but not limited to law enforcement and the education system. I have a 6’2’’ black son who “fits the profile” and has been stopped by police for that reason numerous times, even on his college campus. I worry about him so much that when he enrolled at his university, I took him to the campus police office to introduce him to the officers. I wanted to make sure that he would be recognized as someone who belonged on campus; a task that none of my non-black friends had to engage in or even thought about when they dropped their children off for college. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I have been repeatedly frustrated when, even with overwhelming evidence, the justice system fails black Americans. Cameras on phones and the ability to share videos en masse through social media have highlighted racist occurrences, but oftentimes the offenders end up with what feels like a slap on the wrist (as in the case of Tamir Rice, for example). Each time it happens, it chips away at my faith in justice, makes me fear even more for my son, and reminds me that there’s so much work to do. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One reason that I was excited to join Mikva Challenge Illinois was to have the opportunity to influence systems change. In particular, we run youth councils that interface with Chicago Public Schools, the Chicago Police Department and the Cook County criminal justice system, among others. We intentionally recruit young people from across the city to make sure that we hear perspectives of youth that are often silenced. Our young people, most of whom are black and brown, are invited to have “a seat at the table” and make recommendations about policies that impact them directly. Their voices matter in those spaces and I’m proud to be a part of an organization that makes this possible.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our Mission at Mikva Challenge is to develop youth to be empowered, informed, and active citizens who will promote a just and equitable society and our work is needed now, more than ever. </span></p>
<div class="direct-anchor-wrap"><span id="Robyn" class="direct-anchor" style="visibility: hidden;">.</span></div>
<p><strong>Robyn Lingo, Executive Director, Mikva Challenge DC</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a white woman leading Mikva DC, I’d like to start this statement by saying – I don’t have “the” answers. I make mistakes. I’m not the expert. And I pledge to not take up too much space with these thoughts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But I won’t be silent, and I will act. And I am thinking about how to interrupt white patterns of urgency when the moment calls for thoughtfulness, intentionality, and deep deep listening.  </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like many of us I am struggling with the weight of white supremacy and systemic racism right now. On Friday afternoon, I listened as our Mikva DC students shared the incredible pain, rage, anger, hurt, and fear that comes from living in such a deeply racist society that, in the words of one of our students, “won’t even let us kneel.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Listening to them, I was reminded that as an individual and as an organization, we have work to do to more directly confront the institutional racism in our country and to be more forceful in our racial equity work. As an individual and an organization, I think this requires us to look inwards, while we act externally to back &amp; support the power building of young people of color to directly confront structural racism in our schools, our governments, our communities, and our non-profits. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think we should do that work by living into our values – that adults make better policy when youth voice is included in decision making. In this moment when our country is confronting and wrestling with the unacknowledged depths of racism in our society, it feels ever more urgent, and ever more hopeful, to be supporting and uplifting youth voices. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For myself, I am just trying to be in action as much as possible – create space for healing, support black led organizing, talk to my white family, lead my organization in a way where we are always centering the experiences of people of color over whiteness, etc. And always being accountable for my words, my actions and my in-actions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For the last decade or so, I’ve carried this poster of Audre Lorde with me to every office I have inhabited and I’m missing it these days as we work from home.  As a white queer woman, I have found immense courage and strength in Audre Lorde’s words, and so I will leave them here as my closing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“When I dare to be powerful — to use my strength in the service of my vision, then it becomes less and less important whether I am afraid.” &#8211; Audre Lorde</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<div class="direct-anchor-wrap"><span id="Brian" class="direct-anchor" style="visibility: hidden;">.</span></div>
<p><strong>Brian Brady, President, Mikva Challenge</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The teacher comes when the student is ready” is an old proverb I’ve been thinking about as I absorb the trauma and pain of this period in the wake of the killing of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Ahmaud Arbery, Tony McDade and so many others. I am also absorbing the hope that the protest movement inspires, and I feel some pride in seeing Mikva alumni at the front lines helping lead this movement. However, this is a moment of painful reflection that as a white, straight male with great privilege I have been far too blind to injustices and racism experienced by Black Americans and too slow in advancing my education about concepts of structural racism and historical racism. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I am ashamed to admit that I was slow to accept the term ‘white supremacy’ to describe the current state of America. Today, I realize that the term white supremacy is painfully accurate.  Because of the actions of activists, academics, friends and family, I am fully waking up to the prison, police, military-industrial complex America has embraced, and the connections of racial inequities in our economic, health, education, governmental, and yes, not for profit systems, from 1619 through the last four hundred years of slavery, and post-slavery, white supremacy.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What to do with that awakening is now a personal challenge for me along with figuring out how I can keep educating myself on issues of systemic and structural racism.  And, of course, in Mikva Challenge fashion, move myself from education to action.  As a busy not for profit leader, I always used the excuse that there are a lot of plates to spin every day to keep the doors open and the operation moving forward, and I didn’t have time to read this or attend that workshop.  My promise today is to ditch that excuse and do the darn work, and ask for other white friends and colleagues to join me.  I will also ask my black and POC friends and colleagues to assist.  Lastly, I will look to make amends with the many POC friends and colleagues who tried to awaken me over these past many years, and I will look to do so through both actions and words.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Dahleen Glanton in a recent Chicago Tribune story put it so well, “American racism is a creation of white people and we need to look in the mirror to find the culprit.”  I see it as my primary job at Mikva today to address this problem at its roots and work to awaken fellow white Americans to do the same.</span></p>

leaders to be heard, connected, and celebrated.</p>
<p>Now, in navigating the realities of COVID-19 and all that has meant for our students<br />
and teachers, I have been working to figure out what it means to continue to provide<br />
encouragement, resources, and spaces that amplify student voice, while also<br />
acknowledging that our lives, our routines, our practices, have collectively—and<br />
radically—shifted overnight. Many of the same challenges that our teachers and<br />
students in this city face on a daily basis are now only exacerbated, which at times<br />
renders me feeling powerless. However, instead of screaming into the void, i.e. the<br />
walls of my living room, we at Mikva DC thought it would be more productive to highlight<br />
some teacher voices from the frontlines as they have continued to serve this city’s<br />
young people day in and day out.</p>
<p>In this spirit, we interviewed three Mikva DC educators in the hopes that their responses<br />
could provide some valuable insight to the public, and to city leaders, into how distance<br />
learning in the time of a global pandemic is directly impacting their practice, their<br />
communities, and their students. Our hope is that these perspectives are taken into<br />
account as school and city leaders work to make important decisions about what<br />
academic and social-emotional learning will look for our young people like this fall.<br />
Our participating Mikva DC educators are:</p>
<p><strong>Zachary Larson, Pathways Coordinator, Ballou High School, Ward 8</strong></p>
<p><strong>Karen Lee, High School Social Studies teacher, Thurgood Marshall Academy, Ward 8</strong></p>
<p><strong>Deanna Vaughn, Middle School English Language Arts teacher, Brightwood Education Campus, Ward 4</strong></p>
<p><em>What is it like to be a teacher or student support staff who is trying to support</em><br />
<em>your students from home during COVID-19?</em></p>
<p><strong>Zack Larson:</strong> It has been very challenging. The main questions the students and<br />
parents ask, I do not have the answers for as I await for policy to be released. It’s<br />
important to provide care, compassion and communication during these unprecedented<br />
times and provide students with assistance regarding their needs at this time. The<br />
biggest challenge is ensuring that students remain on a schedule to complete course<br />
work while adhering to their and their families’ needs.</p>
<p><strong>Karen Lee:</strong> I have sat with my computer open trying to answer this question for the<br />
better part of the day and I guess still don’t quite know how to. It isn’t easy- there are<br />
even fewer boundaries for when my teaching day starts and ends than before. I do<br />
better work in the mornings, but my students are mostly online in the afternoon and<br />
evenings. So, I end up working really long hours and I am not the kind of teacher who<br />
won’t respond when a student reaches out for help. I guess like most people, some<br />
days are really good ones and I feel like I can connect and help my students through<br />
whatever they are going through. Other days I feel pretty helpless &#8211; families are losing<br />
jobs, the community is struggling to still stay home and social distance, the number of<br />
COVID-19 cases in Ward 8 is increasing rapidly, my students have had to go out and<br />
get jobs. I can’t help with any of that and all of it is more important than school right<br />
now.</p>
<p><strong>Deanna Vaughn:</strong> Being a teacher who is trying to teach and support students from<br />
home during COVID-19 is overwhelming and frustrating. It is overwhelming because<br />
you have to familiarize yourself with and learn a whole new platform such as Google<br />
Classroom and Microsoft Teams in such little time with little to no training. Trying to get<br />
all the students&#8217; emails or find ways to reach them has been a hassle. In addition,<br />
navigating through the daily technical difficulties&#8211;that can be resolved quickly and in<br />
person in the classroom&#8211;now adds more of a challenge when students are contacting<br />
you saying that a powerpoint won&#8217;t load or they can&#8217;t hear the audio.  When you are<br />
also a teacher who finds assurance in knowing ALL of your students are learning,<br />
interacting, and engaging with your instruction and learning material, it is defeating<br />
when that number of engaged students has dwindled to about a quarter of the normal<br />
engagement you see with your students inside the classroom. Finally, it has been a<br />
challenge, especially when you view your home as your sanctuary to get away from the<br />
strains of work ,but then you somehow have to force yourself to stay focused and<br />
construct a makeshift workplace inside your own living room.</p>
<p><em>What are you noticing from your students as they engage in distance learning?</em></p>
<p><strong>Zack Larson:</strong> I am noticing some students who are normally quiet and soft-spoken have<br />
now taken advantage of the opportunities to connect with teachers and staff that<br />
normally would not have.  I am noticing that our students care for us as we care for<br />
them.  I have had a number of students, check in on me realizing that we are all human<br />
and we are in this together.</p>
<p><strong>Karen Lee:</strong> I teach mostly seniors and it feels a little like they are disappearing. We<br />
had a lot of engagement at first when we thought this would be a few weeks. Some<br />
students who were really quiet in class became more vocal and leaders in the lessons<br />
and office hours. Others had a hard time finding quiet spaces so they were distracted in<br />
trying to connect with their teachers. As more and more time has passed, the focus on<br />
distance learning has changed. Seniors are realizing that their high school life is over and are already pivoting to think about next year. They are morning the loss of prom<br />
and graduation and wondering what campus life will look like at colleges across the<br />
country next year. Conversations are less about government and more about these<br />
uncertainties. Most of my time is spend reassuring that we will figure it out as<br />
information comes in and make sense of it together.</p>
<p><strong>Deanna Vaughn:</strong> About 25% of my students have stayed the course and continued to<br />
invest in their learning by viewing assignments, participating in video<br />
conferences, meeting deadlines, and contacting teachers when they need clarification.<br />
These students are highly motivated and quickly respond to feedback on Google<br />
Classroom and Microsoft Teams.</p>
<p>There is another category of students who started off strong with distance learning, but<br />
as the days have passed, they have lost interest and motivation. These students no<br />
longer view assignments or bother to complete them, nor do they choose to participate<br />
in any form of instruction. Some students also pick which teacher for which they will<br />
submit work, and for others they fail to do any assignments. Another category of students are the students who never learned good time<br />
management or organizational skills. They have expressed how overwhelmed they are<br />
with the number of assignments that are being posted at one time. A large number of<br />
them have given up and needed counseling and intervention to help.<br />
The last category of students are students who do not have the resources or support<br />
and have been unable to participate in distance learning.</p>
<p><em>What types of support do you think your students need the most during this</em><br />
<em>time? OR, What is something you wish more people (more city leaders?) knew</em><br />
<em>about the realities of distance learning in this time?</em></p>
<p><strong>Zack Larson:</strong> I think students need social and emotional support at this time.  A<br />
number of students who are normally very social and are taking the pandemic seriously<br />
are beginning to struggle with self-isolation and not being able to physically see and<br />
interact with their peers and teachers on a daily basis.  I wish more city leaders<br />
understood the challenges our students face from caring for their families, mental health<br />
issues and the lack of resources many families have.  I wish city leaders knew how<br />
fortunate Ballou High School was to have tablets on hand to distribute to students and<br />
families the day before we all left for the pandemic.</p>
<p><strong>Karen Lee:</strong> I wish more city leaders would understand that so many of the things that<br />
students and families are struggling with are the same things they always are struggling<br />
with &#8211; they are just heightened during this time. The digital divide has always been<br />
there, the shortage of food and grocery stores have always been there and traveling to<br />
and from places in this city has always felt unsafe. As DC rebuilds, there is a chance of making a real difference in the way the city runs and the role of students and families<br />
should be centered in that. I also think we should learn from the citywide response of<br />
“all hands on deck” to respond to issues that are critical to the health of our city:<br />
reaching a no murder vision for DC, funding schools in an equitable manner, addressing<br />
affordable housing. All of these issues could and should get the same whole city<br />
attention, without it we will never truly be “safe and healthy.”</p>
<p><strong>Deanna Vaughn:</strong> I think a lot of students need more social/emotional support than<br />
anything else. For kids who need a lot of structure, this pandemic have upended the<br />
routines and schedules that they were used to. I think a lot of students need help with<br />
coping and with their emotions and feelings about not being able to come to school and<br />
see their teachers and peers. Another type of support that I think students need during<br />
this time is access to reliable technology and Wi-Fi. Moving forward, city leaders need<br />
to consider allowing all students to have a laptop at the beginning of the school year so<br />
that they have as many opportunities to learn the appropriate and professional uses of<br />
technology outside of games and social media.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: left;"><strong>&#8220;My experience being a part of Mikva Challenge still shapes the way I engage with my community.&#8221;  </strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">&#8211; Burrell Poe, 2020 Mikva Challenge Outstanding Alum</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Thanks to the outpouring of support we received last week, our <strong>Youth Voices Campaign and Virtual Spring Benefit </strong>reached over 1,300 views and helped to raise over $250,000 in donations to support Mikva youth!</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Due to COVID-19, we had to move our Annual Spring Benefit online this year. And although we were not able to meet in person, through our Virtual Spring Benefit and Youth Voice Campaign we continued to create space to celebrate youth changemakers, civic action and leadership.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Over 8 weeks, we shared stories with you about our powerful youth leaders and about how Mikva Challenge continues to support youth financially and emotionally while providing the space needed to amplify their voices during this crisis. Students shared personal stories on how COVID-19 is impacting the city, their families, their income and their education.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Learn more about this incredible Benefit and Campaign, watch the Virtual event, and watch the personal stories now on our <a href="http://mikvachallenge.org/springbenefit2020">Virtual Spring Benefit and Youth Voices Campaign page</a>.</p>
<p><strong>And once again &#8211; Thank you. We couldn&#8217;t have done it without you. </strong></p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;"><strong>&#8220;My work at Mikva has inspired me to pursue a career in public health and also seeing the effects of COVID 19 has further inspired me to pursue a career that betters health equity.&#8221;  </strong></h3>

<h3>Young people are powerful!</h3>
<p>As an example of their positive ripple effect, Jennifer Bello &#8211; an NYC student, shared her video with her teacher, Ms. Jasmine Toledo who was inspired to share this challenge with her students and with her school administration, and they are discussing ways to make this a school-wide initiative. Her school administration then shared it with their superintendent, who shared the opportunity on Twitter.</p>
<p>Ms. Jasmine Toledo shared her reaction with Mikva Challenge and says,</p>
<h4>&#8220;This is a big deal. I haven’t been excited about something like this since quarantine began. (&#8230;) These projects inspire my students SO much. When they are inspired, I am inspired.&#8221;</h4>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 300;">When our </span><a href="http://www.facebook.com/soapboxnation"><span style="font-weight: 300;">Soapbox Nation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 300;"> submission box was flooded with powerful speeches by students from Fabiana Muench-Casanova’s classes &#8211; we just had to learn more about what was going so well in her Anaheim, CA classroom! </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 300;">This was Fabiana’s first year teaching Project Soapbox, and she used the curriculum in both of her 8th grade US History classes. Which means she gave 66 young people the opportunity to stand up and speak out about an issue that matters to them! </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 300;">She got creative and adapted the lessons to fit her students’ needs. Instead of setting aside a chunk of time to exclusively focus on developing and delivering speeches, she decided to sprinkle Soapbox throughout the school year. She started the year with the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 300;">Creating a Democratic</span></i> <i><span style="font-weight: 300;">Classroom</span></i><span style="font-weight: 300;"> activities as a way to build community and set the tone. Then for each unit, she tied in elements of youth voice and issue identification to keep the content relevant to students. For example, when her students were learning about the British Colonies, Fabiana asked them to think about what issues people were facing that made them leave their home communities to start a new life in the colonies &#8212; and then to consider what kind of problems students see in their own communities. She describes that doing Project Soapbox over the course of the year, “&#8230;enriches my content and gives [students] more time to think about what the purpose of doing these speeches is.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 300;">Another strategy Fabiana used was giving her students plenty of opportunities to practice their speeches in small, rotating groups. Each round, students gave their speech to 3 peer observers. And every rotation they would focus on a different component delivery: eye contact, tone, volume, etc. This way, her students got a lot of practice giving their speech in a low stakes environment before being in the spotlight. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 300;">Fabiana’s most memorable moment from the Soapbox experience was witnessing a student use her speech as a chance to take a risk and be herself with her classmates. Fabiana describes this student as shy, someone who rarely speaks out in class. But she got up and gave a powerful speech about equal rights for LGBTQ communities, and then came out as part of that community herself! The whole class cheered and was very supportive. Fabiana says, “I don’t know if she would have had the courage to come out in another context.”  Major credit to Fabiana for creating a space where her student felt safe to share.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 300;">Fabiana wants to encourage others to do Soapbox with their students, too: “The moment is ripe for an assignment like this.” She says that with the pandemic exposing and exacerbating inequalities, it’s so important for young people to make their voice heard about their needs, and what they want to see in the future. She acknowledges that teachers can often expect the same vocal participants in class &#8211; but Soapbox ignites the quieter, lower-performing students too. She had her class vote on the top speeches, and they chose two struggling students who had come out of their shells in the process. “I saw them think, ‘Oh my God, I did something awesome!’ and it changed the trajectory of their grades for the rest of the year. Honestly. They went from not turning in work, or not being confident to, ‘Yeah! I got this.’ [Soapbox] gave them a sense of confidence that they would have never had without it.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 300;">We are so inspired by Fabiana and her students! For two excellent examples of her students’ work, watch </span><a href="https://youtu.be/dr7h5vFdhK0"><span style="font-weight: 300;">Katelyn</span></a><span style="font-weight: 300;"> and </span><a href="https://youtu.be/GrgITp34Yls"><span style="font-weight: 300;">Scott</span></a><span style="font-weight: 300;">’s speeches. You can find all of them on the </span><a href="http://www.facebook.com/soapboxnation"><span style="font-weight: 300;">Soapbox Nation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 300;"> page. And we are still accepting submissions to Soapbox Nation until May 10, 2020! </span><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vvmoS0bK4fRcrzGb5NdI-qbPjJy4LXl7mqfyysJZ2Ls/edit?usp=sharing"><span style="font-weight: 300;">Here’s how students can participate.</span></a></p>
